long_description: Proper testing is a crucial step when developing new software, but most
people never get past writing basic tests. In this talk, we'll talk
about the philosophy of testing and demonstrate how some advanced
techniques can improve your life.

We'll cover:
- What a "good" test is and why you should write them
- How to design a program to be testable
- Test metrics (coverage, mutation testing)
- Property based testing and fuzzing
- Automatically writing test cases
