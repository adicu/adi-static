ADI will be visiting ProPublica to discuss the role of technology in in their journalism and reporting. We'll be talking with Scott Klein, ProPublica's Deputy Managing Editor and members of their Machine Bias research team.

You'll get to learn about their award-winning reporting and meet some of their journalists for a Q&A.

This is part of an ADI series looking into opportunities in technology that are not based on Software Engineering.
