short_description: Want to learn about different paradigms of computing? Come join us as we talk about the wide field of natural computing! Veer past hard silicon and talk about how computation can performed using bacteria and how we can improve data storage density with DNA! From methods of computation, simulation of nature, or using nature to inspire new algorithms natural computation provides many methods that extends our canonical way of thinking about computing. The first part of this talk will be a general introduction to natural computing and the second part will focus on evolutionary algorithms.
