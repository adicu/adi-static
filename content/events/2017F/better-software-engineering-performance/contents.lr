long_description: With the rise of low-power mobile phones and embedded devices, writing reasonably fast, energy-efficient code is more important than ever. In this talk, we'll cover:

- thinking about performance when coding
- designing your systems and APIs for high performance
- your hardware and why understanding it is important
- how your algorithms professor lied to you about performance

## FAQ

### Who should come to this event?

Anyone who wants to become a better software engineer.

### What background should I have before coming?

Some basic knowledge of computer architecture would be helpful, but not required. Other than that, although no **specific** knowledge should be required, this talk will be aimed at intermediate developers (those with at least one year of CS classes and/or industry experience).
