short_description: In this talk, we will be showing participants how to create change in the world with technology and data science. Our speaker will use his own journey in combatting human trafficking as an example, extracting out themes from these examples.  There will be technical demos throughout, showing the gallery of technical solutions he has used to try to solve this social problem.  The intention is to show the audience how these solutions generalize.  In doing so, the hope is, participants will be able to solve their own social issues.
