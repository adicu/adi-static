In this talk, we'll cover the worldview that Git uses to organize your work, spend some time putting on a firm theoretical foundation (and show where it goes wrong), before doubling back on how you can use this newfound knowledge in your daily life.

This will **not** be an introduction to Git -- you should be already be familiar with basic git commands (like `git add` or `git commit`).
