short_description: Come to hear from our very own ADI alum, Jackie Ho, and learn about User-Centered design and dive into a typical design process with an example app. We'll start with the problem we want to solve, then talk about about how we would figure out what it is we want to build (product validation), then go into  designing an end to end experience (ux) that is usable and understood by users (ui/user testing). Hopefully it will give some insight into what a typical day to day at work would look like as a product designer!
