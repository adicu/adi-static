short_description: Come by Altschul Hall (across from Diana Center on Barnard Campus!) to mingle with our committee members, munch on snacks, and learn more about our committee structure and how it works! This will be a super casual space so feel free to pop in and out whenever you can, though we will have a brief annoucement at 7:15pm.
